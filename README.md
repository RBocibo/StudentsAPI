StudentsAPI
This is Web API that is used create, read and delete data from the database. The ORM used is EF and it uses Repository pattern to form abstraction between data access layer and business logic layer. Also making use of dependency injection to promote easily testability of the services.

I took 5 to 6 hours to design project structure and implementing the solution, and extra 2 hours writing service unit tests.
